# Tableau-Embedding

This project uses V3 of Tableau's embedding API to create a simple webpage with a dashboard embedded from Tableau Public. 
Original dashboard here (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dave.hagen/viz/Superstore_embedded_800x800/Overview).
The index.html file specifies our webpage and the elements on it, while the script.js file defines functions and
builds out the functionality that allows our buttons to filter properly when clicked.
